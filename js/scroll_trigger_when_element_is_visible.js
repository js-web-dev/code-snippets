/* The Intersection Observer API makes it possible to know when an element enters or exits the browser viewport. There is no need to attach any event handlers like scroll triggers (example below). Furthermore, this API is asynchronous â€” monitoring element for visibility is not done on the main thread. This is a major performance boost. */
